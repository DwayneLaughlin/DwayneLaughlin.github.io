 <p> Hi! I'm Dwayne Laughlin. I'm a lifelong Chicagoan currently living in the neighborhood whre I grew up on the Westside. I attended Loyola University Chicago, graduating in summer of 2011 with a BA in Music. Since graduation I have spent time working as a music teacher, performing pianist, composer and producer. For the last 2 years I have also been the current lead for the account management/collections team for zZounds.com, a leading company in the instrument retail business. Part of my day to day job is overlooking some of the coding of our internal wiki page and doing some light coding in HTML. <br><br> I am currently enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp at Northwestern University with a scheduled completion date of March 2020. I hope to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts related to coding both the front end and the backend of a website.  </p>
